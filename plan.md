Detailed Development Plan & Module Breakdown for Jules AI:
I will proceed module by module, providing code and instructions for each.

Phase 1: Backend Core Setup
Module 1.1: Custom User Model & Django Admin Integration

Goal: Replace Django's default User model with a custom one, allowing for future expansion (e.g., specific roles, additional user fields) and integrate it with the Django Admin.

Backend Changes (backend/):

Create apps/users Django app.

Define CustomUser model inheriting from AbstractUser.

Configure AUTH_USER_MODEL in gatepass_core/settings/base.py.

Register CustomUser in apps/users/admin.py.

Update gatepass_core/urls.py to include apps.users.urls (for auth endpoints).

Frontend Impact: No direct UI changes yet, but the authentication system will rely on this.

Jules AI's Output: Will provide code for apps/users/models.py, apps/users/admin.py, gatepass_core/settings/base.py adjustments, and initial apps/users/urls.py (for future authentication views if not using DRF's default views directly). Will explain migrations.

Module 1.2: JWT Authentication Setup

Goal: Implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication for secure API access.

Backend Changes (backend/):

Ensure rest_framework_simplejwt is in INSTALLED_APPS and REST_FRAMEWORK settings are correct.

Add JWT URL patterns to gatepass_core/urls.py.

Frontend Impact: The login process will involve sending credentials to a JWT endpoint and storing the received tokens.

Jules AI's Output: Will provide code for gatepass_core/urls.py additions and confirm gatepass_core/settings/base.py JWT configurations.

Module 1.3: Basic Lookups/Configuration Models

Goal: Create generic models for commonly used, configurable data like VehicleType, PurposeOfTravel, GateLocation. This allows admins to manage these via Django Admin.

Backend Changes (backend/):
