# Gate Pass Management System: Actionable Improvement Plan

This document outlines a prioritized, actionable plan to improve the Gate Pass Management System. It replaces the previous `IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSALS.md` with a clear roadmap for development.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Stability (Critical Priority)

This phase is essential for building a stable foundation. Without a proper testing framework, adding new features is risky and can introduce bugs.

### 1. Establish a Comprehensive Test Suite (Backend)
*   **Goal:** Ensure the existing Django API is reliable and prevent future regressions.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Set up `pytest` and `pytest-django` for a modern testing environment.
    *   Write unit tests for the core models (e.g., `CustomUser`, `GatePass`).
    *   Write API tests for the most critical endpoints (e.g., user login, gate pass creation).
    *   Establish a baseline for code coverage.

### 2. Establish a Comprehensive Test Suite (Frontend)
*   **Goal:** Ensure the Flutter application's UI and logic work as expected.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Write widget tests for important UI components (e.g., login form, home screen).
    *   Write integration tests for critical user flows, such as logging in and creating a gate pass.

## Phase 2: Core Feature Enhancement (High Priority)

Once the testing foundation is in place, we can safely enhance the existing features.

### 3. Enhance Gate Operations and Logging
*   **Goal:** Improve security and provide a clear audit trail for all gate activities.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Expand the `GateOperation` model to log more details.
    *   Create a new API endpoint for administrators to view a detailed, filterable log of all gate operations.
    *   (Frontend) Build a UI to display this log.

### 4. Advanced and Customizable Reporting
*   **Goal:** Provide valuable, data-driven insights to administrators.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create a new `reports` API that allows filtering by date range, pass type, and status.
    *   Implement PDF and CSV export functionality for the reports.
    *   (Frontend) Create a new "Reports" screen to visualize this data.

## Phase 3: New Features and User Experience (Medium Priority)

With a stable and feature-rich core, we can focus on adding new capabilities.

### 5. Implement Push Notifications
*   **Goal:** Provide real-time status updates to users about their gate passes.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for both backend and frontend.
    *   Implement the logic to send notifications on pass approval/rejection.
